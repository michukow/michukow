## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Michal  

🎓 I'm an economics student with a strong interest in technology, startups, and artificial intelligence.  

💡 I focus on learning by building. Most of my projects are practical side projects where I experiment, break things, fix them, and improve step by step.

⚙️ My work often involves:
- Python programming and automation  
- Data analysis and working with real datasets  
- AI-assisted tools and content pipelines  
- Small but complete projects rather than toy examples  

🚀 Currently working on projects that combine economics, data, and technology, with an emphasis on real-world usability rather than academic theory.

📈 Long-term goal: building scalable online projects and products that actually solve problems, not just look good in a portfolio.
